# China-Packaging-Machine-Factory--International-Dilemma
Booming processing service industry stimulates the market demand for packaging machine. This offer china packaging machine factory a good opportunity. From the development stage point of view, china packaging machine is also growing at a rate of 6% per year. Though the <a href="http://www.beveragefillingmachine.com/group-packaging-machine">china packaging machine</a> started relatively late, the progress is very alarming.

In the competition with the European and American enterprises, china packaging machine factory has appeared. Now we are gradually entering into foreign countries. Our domestic packaging machinery is also thinking, what is the way out of our country, the next step we should go? 
Europe and the United States is the most developed countries in the plastic packaging industry in the world. And they emphasize study and develop the advanced packaging machine in order to lay a <a href="http://www.beveragefillingmachine.com/news/china-packaging-machine-factory-international-dilemma.html">good foundation</a> for the production of advanced plastic packaging products. It is understood that the current European and American countries possess the machine with variety style, advanced technology. But to be able to adapt to the competitive international market, they also continue to research and develop more advanced plastic packaging machinery and equipment.

Compared with national machine, China packaging machine is behind in development, performance, quality, reliability, price, service and other aspects. Due to the domestic economic situation is not clear in this year, the invest market has increased risk. 
China <a href="http://www.beveragefillingmachine.com/group-packaging-machine">packaging machine factory</a> should take offensive operations and actively participate in international cooperation even inter industry cooperation, mergers and acquisitions. Through overseas investment, the acquisition of foreign enterprises, it adapt advanced technology and achieve localization as soon as possible to overcome a variety of international and domestic barriers. Eventually it realize the dream of becoming a world-class Multi-National Corporation, and then enhance the international status of China's packaging machinery industry.
